# Venture
## Inspiration: After the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020, long travel has been a great risk to an individual and small businesses have also taken a huge hit. We thought of this very issue and tried to solve it using our website to the best of our abilities. Venture solves these issues by reducing the risk factor of the employer as well as the employee by connecting small businesses with local labour, which prevents the necessity of extensive travelling. Also, local labour always turns out to be cheaper. Thus, this results in the companies cutting down on their expenditure and also helps them thrive in a safer environment.
## What it does: Venture is a user friendly website which enables small businesses find local labour after it filters the possible candidates according to the job requirements using data entered by the user. It contains a chatbot which checks if the candidate is an adult and then moves on to ask the candidate for his/her skills. It then matches the skills with the database of employers and checks if the candidate possesses the required skillset. If it gets a hit in the database, it gives you the job information and proceeds to ask you if you are interested in the opportunity. If the user replies in the affirmative, it provides the contact details of the company and wishes the user luck.
